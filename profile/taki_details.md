#### Core Feature Development

- Designed and implemented agreement-header, line-item, dataset, and modification microservices, supplying CRUD+workflow APIs used by front-end, BI, and third-party integrations.

- Authored > automated unit/integration tests in PyTest and jest, maintaining > 90 % coverage for contract modules.

#### Low-Code Flow Orchestrator

- Extended the in-house drag-and-drop orchestration engine: published 50+ reusable “action blocks” (Contract lifecycle management, SAP create, Outlook send, DocuSign sign, Teams notify).

- Enabled legal and procurement staff to automate contract lifecycles without developer intervention, cutting turnaround from days to hours.

#### Real-Time & Messaging Architecture

- Built a Redis Streams + Kafka fabric for high-throughput event propagation between microservices; sustained >15 k events/sec in load tests.

- Introduced Socket.io-based user-activity streams feeding an Elasticsearch audit index; supports SOC-2 log-retention policy (365 days).

#### Performance & Reliability

- Profiled SQLAlchemy hotspots, rewrote queries with CTEs and proper indexes; improved contract-search latency from ~750 ms to <180 ms (P95).

- Added Prometheus alerts for SLA breaches; mean-time-to-detect dropped by 40 %.
